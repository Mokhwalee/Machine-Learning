# üìò Machine Learning Study

This repository is a curated study guide for fundamental concepts in **Machine Learning (ML)**. It covers both **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning methods, following widely accepted definitions and examples, with reference to [GeeksforGeeks: Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/).

## üîç Overview

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This study guide organizes ML concepts into two main categories:

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**

## ‚úÖ Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the input comes with the correct output. The aim is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

### üß± Algorithms and Concepts:
- **Linear Regression**  
  Predicts a continuous value using a linear relationship between input and output variables.
  
- **Logistic Regression**  
  A classification algorithm used to predict discrete values (e.g., 0 or 1).

- **Decision Trees**  
  Tree-based models that split the dataset based on features to make predictions.

- **Random Forest**  
  An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
  Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data into different classes.
  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  A lazy learner algorithm that classifies a new data point based on similarity to k neighbors.
  
- **Naive Bayes**  
  A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with strong independence assumptions.
  
- **Boosting Algorithms**  
  Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees). It works sequentially, where each new model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones.

## üîì Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to identify patterns, groupings, or structures within the data without guidance.

### üß± Algorithms and Concepts:
- **K-Means Clustering**  
  Partitions the data into k clusters based on feature similarity.
  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning**
  Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward over time.
